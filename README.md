## About Me

I am a Software Engineer specializing in high-performance fullstack applications with Rust. My main expertise is in Actix Web for scalable backends, Leptos for reactive frontends, and Diesel/SQLx for robust database access.  

I design and build GraphQL & REST APIs, responsive UIs with Tailwind CSS, and modern cross-platform apps with Tauri. My work spans PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, and applied projects in Robotics & AI/ML.  

On the DevOps side, I rely on Docker for containerization, Git/GitHub for version control, and GitHub Actions for CI/CD. Always focusing on clean architecture, maintainable code, and reliable deployments.  

I use a minimalist Arch Linux + i3 setup with Neovim, Alacritty, Zsh, and tmux, optimized for speed, efficiency, and distraction free development.
