I'm a Software Engineer with a strong focus on Rust, building modern full stack applications using Leptos and Actix Web to deliver high performance frontends and APIs. Rust is my primary language because it offers the reliability, speed, and safety essential for robust production systems.

I'm also experienced with Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js (Express), Tailwind CSS, and MongoDB, and can seamlessly collaborate on teams using JavaScript or TypeScript stacks or hybrid architectures.

I value clean, maintainable code and thrive in cross functional teams, regardless of the tech stack. I build cross platform applications for web, mobile, and desktop using Rust and Tauri, and adapt quickly to new technologies and team workflows.

My development environment is Arch Linux with Neovim, Alacritty, Zsh, tmux, and the i3 window manager, a keyboard driven setup that enables a fast, efficient, and distraction free workflow.
