## About Me

Iâ€™m a Software Engineer who focuses on building reliable applications with **Rust**. I work with **Actix Web** for backends, **Leptos** for frontends, and use **Diesel** and **SQLx** with databases like **PostgreSQL** and **MongoDB**. I also enjoy creating cross-platform apps with **Tauri** and building interfaces with **Tailwind CSS** and **Material UI**.  

I like solving technical challenges that require both system-level thinking and practical application, and I often explore how **Robotics** and **AI/ML** can be applied in real projects.  

For development and deployment, I use **Docker**, **Git/GitHub**, and **GitHub Actions** to keep things consistent and automated. My daily setup is **Arch Linux with i3**, **Neovim**, **Alacritty**, **Zsh**, and **tmux**, which helps me stay fast, efficient, and focused.
