I’m a Software Engineer with a strong focus on Rust, building modern full stack applications using Leptos and Actix Web for high performance frontends and APIs. Rust is my primary language because it gives me the reliability, speed, and safety needed for serious production systems.

That said, I’m not limited to Rust. I also work with Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js (Express), Tailwind CSS, and MongoDB, and can easily collaborate with teams using JavaScript or TypeScript stacks or hybrid architectures.

I bring a systems level mindset to web development, care about clean and maintainable code, and thrive in cross functional teams whether the codebase is in Rust or not. I can learn new concepts or technologies in less than a day and start using them immediately, continuously improving as I build projects with them, making me highly adaptable to any team’s tools and workflows.
