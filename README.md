## About Me

Iâ€™m a ðŸ¦€ Software Engineer specializing in high-performance fullstack applications with Rust. My primary stack combines Actix Web for scalable backends, Leptos for reactive frontends, and Diesel/SQLx for efficient database access. I build robust GraphQL & REST APIs, responsive interfaces with Tailwind CSS, and cross-platform applications using Tauri.

Iâ€™m experienced with PostgreSQL and MongoDB for data-driven systems, and I enjoy solving complex problems at both the application and database layer. Beyond web development, I explore Robotics and AI/ML, applying Rust and modern technologies to build intelligent, efficient systems.

On the DevOps side, I use Docker for containerization, Git/GitHub for version control, and GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation. Always aiming for clean architecture, maintainable code, and reliable deployments.

My development workflow is built around Arch Linux with i3, Neovim, Alacritty, Zsh, and tmux, optimized for speed, minimalism, and distraction free development.
