I’m a Software Engineer with a strong focus on Rust, building modern full stack applications using Leptos and Actix Web for high-performance frontends and APIs. Rust is my primary language because it provides the reliability, speed, and safety required for serious production systems.

That said, I’m not limited to Rust. I also work with Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js (Express), Tailwind CSS, and MongoDB, and can easily collaborate with teams using JavaScript or TypeScript stacks or hybrid architectures.

I care about clean, maintainable code and thrive in cross-functional teams, whether the codebase is in Rust or not. I can build cross-platform applications for web, mobile, and desktop using Rust and Tauri. I pick up new technologies in less than a day and start using them immediately, continuously improving as I build. This makes me highly adaptable to any team’s tools and workflows.

For my development environment, I use Arch Linux with Neovim, Alacritty, Zsh, tmux, and the i3 window manager. This mouseless, keyboard-driven setup enables a fast, efficient, and distraction-free workflow that helps me stay productive, focused, and get things done quickly.
