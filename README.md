Hi, Iâ€™m a Software Engineer who focuses on building reliable applications with Rust. I work with Actix Web for backends, Leptos for frontends, and use Diesel and SQLx with PostgreSQL and MongoDB. I also build cross-platform apps with Tauri and sleek UIs using Tailwind CSS and Material UI.

Passionate about computer vision, AI/ML, and YOLO models, especially for game automation and real-time detection. I love applying physics and math to solve challenging problems.

I containerize with Podman and Docker, automate with GitHub Actions, and develop on Arch Linux using i3, Neovim, Alacritty, Zsh, and tmux for maximum speed and focus.
