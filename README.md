I'm a Software Engineer specializing in high-performance full-stack applications with Rust. I leverage Leptos for blazing-fast frontends and Actix Web for robust APIs, valuing Rust's unmatched speed, safety, and reliability in production.

Beyond Rust, I'm proficient in Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js (Express), Tailwind CSS, and MongoDB, facilitating seamless collaboration across modern web stacks. My expertise also spans cross-platform app development (Web, Desktop, Mobile with Tauri) and embedded systems with ESP32.

I'm deeply committed to clean, maintainable code and thrive in cross-functional teams. My workflow is highly optimized by a keyboard-driven Arch Linux setup, utilizing i3, Neovim, Alacritty, Zsh, and tmux for peak efficiency and deep focus.
