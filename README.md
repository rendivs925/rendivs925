I'm a Software Engineer focused on building high-performance fullstack applications with Rust. I specialize in Leptos and Actix Web to deliver fast, reliable frontends and APIs, and use Rust for its unmatched speed, safety, and reliability in production systems.

I'm also proficient with Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js (Express), Tailwind CSS, and MongoDB, enabling smooth collaboration in modern JavaScript, TypeScript, or hybrid Rust stacks. I build cross-platform apps for web, desktop, and mobile using Rust and Tauri, and I develop embedded systems with ESP32 using the Rust ecosystem.

I value clean, maintainable code and excel in cross-functional teams. My development setup consists of Arch Linux, Neovim, Alacritty, Zsh, tmux, and i3, a keyboard-driven environment optimized for deep focus and high efficiency.
